## Project Description:
Whether you live in a large house or a cozy apartment, keeping track of the items in your home can be a tedious process. While it may seem like a chore, taking the time to assess and organize your home inventory is a great way to keep track of what you have.

‘Fixer’ will allow you to easily store anything you can think of. It will let you organize your inventory in several different folders and subfolders to make things easier to locate. Use folders to group items by their physical locations like which room or which cabinet they are stored in or by item type. Add searchable tags and notes to find what you need in seconds.

For this project our team will create a product that allows users to easily manage and track their possessions in a easy to use and quick to learn way.
